# C# Chapter 5 HW

1. **What is a** ***compound assignment operator*** **? How does it work?** A way to provide a shorter syntax for assigning an end value. By performing both operands before assigning the result. variable += 5 is the same as variable = variable + 5
2. **List all the compound assignment operators.**
	- *=
	- /=
	- %=
	- +=
	- -=
3. **List two ways to increment a numeric variable by 5. List two ways to decrement a numeric variable by 50.** 
	- variable += 5 and variable = variable + 5
	- variable -=50 and variable = variable - 50
4. **How long does a** ***while*** **loop run?** Until its boolean expression evaluates to false.
5. **What happens if you don't change the loop variable in the body of the while loop block?** The loop will never terminate. Infinite Loop.
6. **How many parts does a** ***for*** **loop statement have? Can you omit any of them? Can you omit all of them? What happens if you omit all of them?** 4, initialization, boolean expression, update control variable, statement. Yes. Yes, but why would you? Then there is no for loop.
7. **How do you guarantee that a loop runs at least once?** Use a DO While loop.
8. **What does the** ***break*** **statement do?** Breaks you out of the body of an iteration statement.
9. **What does the** ***continue*** **statement do?** Causes the program to perform the next iteration of the loop immediately.
