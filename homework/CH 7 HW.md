12. **Consider this quote by Alexander Stepanov:**
> **I ﬁnd OOP technically unsound. It attempts to decompose the world in terms of interfaces that vary on a single type. To deal with the real problems you need multi-sorted algebras — families of interfaces that span multiple types. I ﬁnd OOP philosophically unsound. It claims that everything is an object. Even if it is true it is not very interesting — saying that everything is an object is saying nothing at all.
